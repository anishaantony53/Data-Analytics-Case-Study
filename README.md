# Data-Analytics-Case-Study
Analyzed global food labeling practices using the Open Food Facts database, applying SQL, visualization, and statistical models to evaluate additives, health claims, and nutritional accuracy.
# Food Labeling Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes **food labeling systems, additives, packaging, and nutritional composition** using the **Open Food Facts** dataset.  
The case study investigates whether health-related labels (e.g., *organic, vegan, gluten-free*) accurately reflect nutrition, and explores patterns in additive use, brand strategies, and missing nutritional data.  

##  Objectives
- Assess brand-level differences in the use of additives (E100 Curcumin, E110 Sunset Yellow).  
- Analyze adoption of health-related labels across brands.  
- Compare sugar and energy content of organic vs. non-labeled products.  
- Evaluate missing nutrient values (sugars, proteins, energy, salt) across categories.  

##  Tools & Techniques
- **SQL**: Data extraction & queries from relational Open Food Facts database.  
- **Python/Excel/Visualization**: Charts (bar plots, boxplots, heatmaps) for brand-level comparisons.  
- **Statistical Models**: Hypothesis testing, Mannâ€“Whitney U, OLS regression.  

##  Key Findings
- Additive usage varies by brand and category; E110 is more prevalent in beverages & confectionery.  
- Health-related labels are unevenly used; adoption often reflects **marketing** rather than nutrition.  
- Organic products show no statistically significant reduction in sugar or energy compared to non-labeled items.  
- Missing nutrient data is **non-random**, concentrated in artisanal and specialty foods, risking biased analysis.  

##  Outcomes
- Improved understanding of how food labels align (or misalign) with actual nutrition.  
- Recommendations for consumers, policymakers, and food industry stakeholders on transparency and labeling standards.
